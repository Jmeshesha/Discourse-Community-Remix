# Discourse Communities in Game Development.

Hello,
I'm a game developer and I want to talk about discourse communities. I hope to explain what a discourse community is, why the gaming community is a discourse community, how I use it to develop games, and why do you care.

## What is a discourse community

There are [a lot of defintions](https://www.youtube.com) of a discourse community but I define it as any group of people who communicate using words specific to the group in order to achieve some goals.
