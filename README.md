# Discourse Communities in Game Development

Discourse communities are an incredibly useful topic that can be used to develop features in games that more align with what players want. In this article, I hope to explain what a discourse community is, why the gaming community is a discourse community, and how it could be useful when you develop games.

## What is a Discourse Community

The topic of discourse communities originated in academic studying of writing. The exact definition of a discourse community is [not agreed upon](Borg.pdf), but I think its definition depends on the context. For developing software in general, I think a useful definition of a discourse community is any group of people who communicate using words specific to the group in order to achieve some shared goals. The key thing about this definition is the requirement of shared goals. This is important for developing software since software developers solve problems that often times discourse communities face when trying to achieve their goals.

## Why the Gaming Community is a DC

The gaming community is a discourse community. Although some might say there isn't a shared goal in the gaming discourse community, it can be argued that the goals of the gaming community is to increase skill of the community and to maintain and improve the enjoyment of games. However, each goal is not treated equally in every game. In some more competitive games like League of Legends and Counter Strike, increasing the skill level of the community is maybe slightly more important that maintaining enjoyment. But, in some more casual games like Among Us and Minecraft, enjoyment is a little more focused on than improving the skill of the community. This idea can be seen in the way each of these games own communities communicate. 

As you probably know, the gaming community communicates mostly through youtube, reddit, twitch, and discord. Looking at the posts and videos surrounding something like League of Legends, you'll see a lot tutorials on how to get better at the game and that the top streamer/youtubers are usually people who are the best at the game. Certainly entertainment is a big part of this content but there's almost a bit more focus on skill. 

Inversly, looking at the post and videos surrounding something like Minecraft, you'll see streamers/youtubers that aren't the best players but are entertaining. Again, skill can play an important part in these games especially looking at the speedruning, however entertainment is slightly more important.

There are many words that are specific to gaming that players use to communicate about these goals. These include AOE, mmo, rpg, fps, and alot more. Also, each indivual game has there own set of terms.

## How does studying DCs help in Game Dev

As stated in the "What is a Discourse Community Section", software developers solve problems problems that inhibit the goals of discourse communities. Since game developers are software developers, this also applys to game development. 


The previous section talked about how there are two goals in the gaming discourse community and how important they are in a games community is dependant on what kind of game they are. Studying this idea is increadibly important as it can show you what features a game community wants. For instance, the community of a competative game like Counter Strike will most likely want more things to be more balanced so that the game is mostly skill based. The community of a more casual game, on the otherhand, like amoung us may something like more maps which may be harder to balence but are more fun.


However, things aren't exactly black and white and a community who focuses on one goal may want to improve the other. Lets look back at the Counter Strike example. In that game, there's a bug called bunnyhopping that allows you to increase your movement speed by jumping and turning the camera while moving a certain way. This bug allowed things to happen in the game that made things unfair so naturally a game developer would be inclined to remove it completely. However, the bug also changed the way people played the game in a good way and people created minigames out of it. Instead of completely removing it, the developer decided to just modify it slighly so that both parties are happy. Someone who didn't understand the discourse community fully might have removed the bug all together.
